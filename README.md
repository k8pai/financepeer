### Getting started

1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
2. Install the dependencies: `npm install`
3. Create a `.env` file in the root directory of the project and add the following environment variables:

```
MONGODB_URI=YOUR_MONGODB_URI
NEXTAUTH_URL=http://localhost:3000
NEXTAUTH_SECRET=YOUR_NEXTAUTH_SECRET

GOOGLE_ID='xxxxxxxxxxxxxxx-xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx.apps.googleusercontent.com'
GOOGLE_SECRET='GOCSPX-xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx'
```

4. Start the development server: `npm run dev`

### Usage

1. To upload a JSON file, go to `http://localhost:3000/` and select the JSON file to upload.
2. To view the data saved in the database, go to `http://localhost:3000/saved`.

### Files

There is a `data` folder that contains all the files that are of json type, some matching the validations and some other files to mockup possible errors. You can Upload new files as you wish or can go with the test files ranging from `test1.json` to `test6.json`.

### Styling and themes

This application uses TailwindCSS for styling and themes. You can customize the styling and themes by editing the `tailwind.config.js` file.

### Deployment

To deploy this application, you can use any Next.js hosting provider.

### Database

```
Database: <database name>

Collections:
- File
- JsonRecord

Documents:

File:
  _id: <ObjectId>
  fileName: <String>
  email: <String>
  jsonRecords: [
    {
      _id: <ObjectId>
      id: <String>
      userId: <String>
      title: <String>
      body: <String>
      fileId: <ObjectId>
    },
    ...
  ]

JsonRecord:
  _id: <ObjectId>
  id: <String>
  userId: <String>
  title: <String>
  body: <String>
  fileId: <ObjectId>

Relationships:

File -> JsonRecord (1-to-many)
```

### Collections

**File**

-   The `File` collection contains documents that represent files.
-   The document also has a `fileName` field, which is the name of the file, and an `email` field, which is the email address of the user who uploaded the file.

**JsonRecord**

-   The `JsonRecord` collection contains documents that represent the JSON records in a file.
-   The document has the following fields that comes from each `.json` file.
    -   `id`
    -   `userId`
    -   `title`
    -   `body`
-   There's an additional field, `fileId`, which is the identifier of the file that contains the record.

**Relationship**

-   The `File` and `JsonRecord` collections are related through a 1-to-many relationship.
-   The relationship is implemented through the `fileId` field in the `JsonRecord` document, which references the `id` field in the `File` document.
